    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a dedicated tech enthusiast currently pursuing a Backend Engineering
      program at Alt School Africa. My primary focus is on backend and
      full-stack development, as well as software engineering. I possess a
      strong foundation in JavaScript and Python and am actively working to
      enhance my skills in TypeScript. I'm genuinely passionate about the
      boundless opportunities presented by technology and am eager to make
      meaningful contributions to the ever-evolving field of software
      development.
